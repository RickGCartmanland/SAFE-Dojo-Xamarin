# Xamarin Forms implementation of the SAFE Dojo

This dojo is a translation of some components of the SAFE dojo to Xamarin Forms using the recent work on Elmish.XamarinForms. You'll need to run the SAFE dojo as well to have the corresponding web services running at the same time. Get that from https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo
